"""Hold the security-property registry against the tree, both ways.

`assurance/properties.toml` names the security properties; `assurance/crates.toml`
classifies every workspace member. Everything else this gate reports — which
module defines a property, which configurations check it, which mutants target
it, which Kani harnesses, fuzz targets, Rust files and device tests carry its
name — is DERIVED here and printed, never stored. The registry's own worked
example is why: a hand-written evidence record for the tree's best-documented
property was wrong in three of six fields before any code existed (three
mutants listed of seven, two owner files of three, and two runtime tests that
do not exist). Deriving is not a nicety; it is the difference between a
registry and a fourth hand-kept roster, and this tree has already deleted one
guard that grew 800 lines defending three copies of a list.

What is checked, and the direction of each check:

* every invariant or temporal property that any formal/*.cfg actually checks
  has exactly one registry entry — so nothing TLC verifies is unnamed; and
  every non-risk entry names something a configuration actually checks — so
  the registry cannot advertise properties nothing verifies. This one check
  also covers mutant orphans: a Solo_*.cfg aimed at an unregistered invariant
  is an unregistered checked name.
* a status must equal the evidence ceiling. A Kani harness carrying the
  property's name forces BOUNDED; none allows only MODELLED-ONLY. PROVEN and
  OBSERVED are refused outright until evidence of those classes exists in the
  tree — a status rule nothing can trip is a check that cannot fail.
* ACCEPTED-RISK entries carry a ruling and are exactly the entries with no
  model: a ruled-away risk must be visible, and a checked invariant must not
  be filed as one.
* every formal/*.cfg is in a tier of `run-tlc.sh --tiers` or in [`EXEMPT_CFG`]
  with its reason — the "20 of 49 proofs run by nothing" class, one layer up.
* every [workspace] member appears in the crate ledger and vice versa, and
  each class carries what it obliges: a model that exists, a named gap, a
  planned roadmap module, evidence that is what [`EVIDENCE_SUFFIX`] says the
  field names — the crate's own differential/KAT/proof files — or a reason. That
  last one used to be "a file that exists", which is a rule `README.md` meets
  ([`platform_gate.PROSE_PAGE`] is the same sentence on the other axis). The
  ledger
  exists because two roadmap drafts enumerated crates from memory and missed
  four, including the second-largest in the tree.

Deliberately syntactic, like its siblings: it cannot say a statement means
what the invariant checks, or that an evidence file proves anything. It says
the graph is closed — nothing checked is unnamed, nothing named is unchecked,
nothing ships silently unclassified.

    The `kani`/`tests` filename filter this replaced read a NAME, and the six

    (`#[cfg(any(kani, test))]`) was counted as a production owner of

    `SEC-TRANS-003` — §2 principle 7 in the one direction it forbids, a
    proof-only mirror standing in for the code it mirrors.

    A file is reached through a declaration, through the directory a declaration
    shuts, or through a chain of both, so the closure is a fixed point over all
    three. The DIRECTORY under a withheld declaration is shut —
    `crates/rsk-fido/src/lib.rs` says `#[cfg(test)] mod conformance;` and
    `conformance/mod.rs` then declares its eighteen siblings plainly, every one a
    production owner-in-waiting. And a file whose `mod` declarations ALL sit in
    withheld files is shut with them, because a `#[path]` leaf need not live
    under the directory that named it: `crates/rsk-oath/src/tests.rs` is withheld
    and names `code_tests.rs`, which sits BESIDE it and not under the `tests/`
    that shuts. Measured, eleven such files — and the sentence that stood here
    said they were "held out today only by the legacy name filter", which the
    same commit's own fixed point had already made false. Re-measured before the
    filter was deleted: the filter decided ZERO files, `production_rust` being
    182 with it and 182 without.

    The last way in is the file's OWN prologue. An inner `#![cfg(test)]` shuts a
    module whatever its declaration says, and no spelling of a declaration can
    see it; that is [`_self_withheld`], and it is the direction the name filter
    was standing in for without ever being able to reach — a `helper.rs` is
    spelled like production and a `manifests.rs` like a test.

    One live declarer keeps a file: the same source can be `#[path]`-included
    from a shipped module and from a test. Only the directory half can still
    drop such a file (a production `#[path = "conformance/shared.rs"]` under a
    withheld `conformance/`), and it does so LOUDLY — the file stops owning its
    tag and `check_tags` names the unowned invariant.

    The closure was `matrix_gate.production_rust`'s alone. It belongs at THIS
    layer, where the reader lives and where `evidence_gate` also calls in;
    `matrix_gate` imports this module, so the edge only runs one way, and its
    own copy now filters an already-closed set rather than answering second.

    """Every `.rs` some buildable image compiles, and nothing else.

    What decides it is [`cfg_excluded`] alone — the cfg on the declarations that
    reach a file, plus the cfg it applies to itself. A `"kani" not in f.name and
    "tests" not in f.name` filter stood here as well until this commit, and it
    read a SPELLING: an `attests.rs` would have been withheld for holding the
    letters `tests`, and a `helper.rs` under a `#[cfg(test)] mod` kept for not.
    Deleting it moved nothing — 182 files before and after, the same list both
    ways and no printed column — because every file it decided is decided by a
    cfg too. What it cost while it stood is at [`ROOT_MODULES`]: it was hiding
    the resolution rule's failures behind their file names.

    Not cargo's own answer, which was the third candidate. A dep-info file is the
    list for ONE feature combination, so a single unit under-counts production
    for everything behind a feature that build did not set: measured against the
    `firmware.d` `check.sh` leaves in `target/`, 38 of these 182 are absent —
    every `rsk-ui` render screen, `rsk-display` and `rsk-slip39` among them, and
    each one is code some image ships. Unioning the combinations means building
    them all, inside a registry gate whose own docstring says it is deliberately
    syntactic, and the verdict would then depend on a toolchain and a build
    cache. Nor "the file's items are all cfg-gated", which needs an item parser
    to answer and gets a file of test helpers around one shipped `pub fn` wrong
    in the direction that hides an owner. The declaration and the prologue are
    read off the tree and cost a regex.

    One thing the filter did that this does NOT: an ORPHAN — a file no `mod`
    declaration reaches and no manifest names as a root — is compiled by nothing
    and is counted production here anyway. Deliberate, and it is the direction
    [`_cfg_atom`] argues for: withholding an orphan means trusting the resolver's
    completeness, and a resolver gap would then hide a real owner silently
    instead of over-counting one. The shipped tree has none — every `.rs` under
    `crates/*/src` and `firmware/src` is reached by a declaration or is a crate
    root, measured, which is what makes the closure a closure. `test_matrix_gate`
    has one, and it is a `screen_kani.rs` that nothing declares.

    Mutation table for the classifier, driven through `check_property_tags` on a
    fixture and re-driven on a copy of the shipped tree:

    * `helper.rs` under `#[cfg(test)] mod helper;` in a NON-`mod.rs` parent,
      carrying an invariant's only tag → red, `no Refines tag in production
      Rust`. Before [`_child_home`] the declaration resolved to nothing and the
      leaf was a production owner at EXIT=0.
    * the same file with the `#[cfg(test)]` removed → green. Depth and the
      parent's shape are not what withholds it; the cfg is.
    * `crates/rsk-device/src/attests.rs`, plainly declared, carrying that tag →
      green here, red under the re-inserted name filter with the same `no
      Refines tag` message. The message is the tell: it is the finding for a
      MISSING owner, printed over a file every image compiles.
    * a prologue `#![cfg(test)]` over a plainly-declared file → red. Without
      [`_self_withheld`] a proof-only mirror stands in as the owner, which is the
      `*_assurance.rs` defect with the gate on the other side of the file.
    * `mod inner { #![cfg(test)] }` inside a shipped file → green. A scan that
      reads the whole text instead of the prologue takes that file's tag with it
      and the row reports an owner that is sitting right there.
    * a prologue `#![cfg(target_os = "none")]` → green. `is False` and not `is
      not True`: a satisfiable expression keeps the file, and the mutant reading
      the three-valued answer as two drops a shipped owner.

#: What a `pure` row's `evidence` must BE. Not open-ended: this ledger's own
#: header says the field "names the differential/KAT/proof files", so the honest
#: set is nameable rather than merely non-prose — measured, 20 paths over 9 rows,
#: every one a `.rs` under its own crate's `src/` or under `fuzz/fuzz_targets/`.
#: Before this, the test was `.is_file()`: `evidence = ["README.md"]` on
#: `rsk-led` was **exit 0** once `--write-readme` was run, and so was
#: `["README.MD"]`, which APFS folds and no suffix rule does.
#:
#: WHY NOT [`platform_gate.PROSE_PAGE`]'s RULE, which this replaces the missing
#: half of. That axis refuses one KIND of file and says outright it cannot check
#: relevance; copied here it is INSUFFICIENT rather than wrong, because
#: `["deny.toml"]` and `["assurance/crates.toml"]` are not pages and are not
#: differentials either. Its generated-page carve-out is the wrong shape here
#: too: `formal/README.md` is the page THIS gate writes and
#: [`crate_ledger_table`] prints each `pure` row's own evidence into it, so the
#: carve-out would admit a row settled by the page that prints its settlement.
#: The suffix half refuses every page, generated or not, and that loop with it —
#: which is why there is no separate `circular` clause here.
#:
#: REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT, not taste. Tying evidence to the row's own subject is
#: the strong form `platform_gate` had to reject (two of its three honest rows go
#: red); on THIS axis it costs zero, because a `pure` row's subject is a
#: directory rather than a prose assumption. The step ABOVE it is what fails
#: here: requiring a cited fuzz target to name its crate reddens
#: `fuzz/fuzz_targets/mldsa_roundtrip.rs` and `mldsa_verify.rs`, which are
#: `rsk-mldsa`'s evidence and reach it through `rsk_crypto`'s re-export —
#: `fuzz/Cargo.toml` names `rsk-mldsa` nowhere. Two of twenty, and for the same
#: reason as the platform refutation: the tie runs through an indirection. So
#: the fuzz half below is a DIRECTORY allowance and not a tie.
#:
#: WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT CHECK. That the file is REACHED by its crate's module
#: tree: `crates/rsk-slip39/src/tests.rs` is hooked in as a plain `mod tests;`
#: while every other cited file uses `#[path]`, so both forms would have to be
#: resolved — the "proofs run by nothing" class one layer out, and a bigger thing
#: than this. And a `pure` crate whose differential legitimately lived in a
#: SIBLING crate would be a false red; none does today.
